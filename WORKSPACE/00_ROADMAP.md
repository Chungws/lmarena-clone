## 🔭 Project Vision

llmbattler is an **AI Language Model Battle Arena** that enables unbiased evaluation of LLMs through blind side-by-side testing.

### Core Values
1. **Objectivity**: Blind testing eliminates model bias
2. **Data-Driven**: Collect real user preferences to improve LLM evaluation
3. **Transparency**: Open leaderboards show fair, ELO-based rankings
4. **Flexibility**: Support any OpenAI-compatible LLM (local or external)

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router, React Server Components)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS (or shadcn/ui)
- TypeScript 5
- Playwright MCP (UI testing)

**Backend (API Server):**
- FastAPI (async ASGI)
- SQLModel + SQLAlchemy 2.0 (PostgreSQL ORM)
- Motor or PyMongo (MongoDB driver)
- Alembic (migrations)
- pytest (TDD)
- httpx (LLM API client)

**Worker (Data Aggregation):**
- Python 3.11+
- APScheduler (hourly jobs)
- databases + asyncpg (PostgreSQL async driver)

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL 16 (single database for all data)
  - sessions, battles (JSONB), votes, model_stats, worker_status

**AI Inference:**
- Ollama (local models)
- vLLM (GPU inference)
- External APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker + Docker Compose (local dev)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)
