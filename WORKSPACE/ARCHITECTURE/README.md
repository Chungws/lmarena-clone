### ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

- **[ADR-001: No Database-Level Foreign Key Constraints](./ADR_001-No_Foreign_Keys.md)**
  - Decision: Do NOT use database-level FK constraints, manage in application code
  - Reason: Microservice readiness, horizontal scalability, performance
  - Impact: Data integrity must be ensured in service layer with transactions

## ðŸ“– What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record documents important architectural decisions made in the project.

**ADR Structure:**
- **Context:** Background why the decision was needed
- **Decision:** What was decided
- **Rationale:** Reasons and considerations for the decision
- **Consequences:** Positive/negative impacts and mitigation strategies

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Write an ADR?

Consider writing an ADR for:

1. Tech stack selection (DB, Framework, Library)
2. Design pattern selection (architecture style, data modeling)
3. Policies that differ from standard practices
4. Important decisions that affect future maintenance

## ðŸ’¡ Tip

When implementing new features or changing existing structure, check ADRs in this folder first. They help you understand the project's design philosophy.
